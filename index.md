# Welcome to Wild About Pilates

We offer modified physio led Pilates sessions in Macclesfield.  Although it’s Physio led that doesn’t mean that it’s just for people with injuries – the exercises can be modified from beginner level to elite level athletes. But what it does mean is that you are under the supervision of a qualified physiotherapist with the ability to adapt exercises to meet your needs.

If you do have problems such as back pain, this method is a safe and effective way to help improve strength, posture, balance and flexibility. It also promotes well being and is an enjoyable way to exercise.

Most of us have something we can improve, whether it be to improve fitness, strength or balance. Pilates is a great way to address all of these areas and more.

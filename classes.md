Taster session

: First session £8.50 with no obligation. At Wild About Pilates we want people to come and see what it’s all about.

Block bookings

: The classes are £8.50 per session and run in blocks of 6 which are to be paid in full in advance.  Block-bookings take priority over ad-hoc bookings, and your place will be reserved.

Ad-hoc sessions

: Ad-hoc classes are £10 per session and subject to availability.  Booking is essential. Please text me or email and I will get back to you to confirm your place.  

Refer a friend

: If you refer a friend into one of the classes (it doesn't have to be the same class that you attend), and they sign up to a block of 6, the referrer gets a free session in their next block.

### One-to-one sessions

There is a £5 discount for class attendees.

60-minute initial assessment: £50

: This includes an assessment of your posture, spinal range of movement and muscle length and function. You will learn the Pilates key elements and how to engage your centre. I will teach you some of the main Pilates exercises, and you will be provided with 3 exercises which are tailored specifically to help you, which you can practice independently in your own time.

60 minute tailored session: £50

: You must have completed the initial assessment first.

Today has been a great day for learning, sharing ideas, and doing Pilates myself with fellow physio's and Pilates instructors.  I've been on a Pilates For Runners course delivered by The Australian Physiotherapy and Pilates Institute.

It's been a really fun day, and I am looking forward to bringing some fresh ideas and new combinations to my classes.  Those of you that run will get lots of tips and tricks to help improve balance, core control, performance, and to reduce fatigue.  For those that don't run, you can still benefit from the balance, flexibility and strengthening exercises which can be adapted to all ability levels!

I've produced a 10 minute Pilates workout available to anyone attending my classes. This can be used while on holiday, if you miss a class, or if you want to do a little extra during the week.

*Disclaimer:* This program has been developed only for those who attend my classes *and* have been identified as suitable to use it.

Enjoy!

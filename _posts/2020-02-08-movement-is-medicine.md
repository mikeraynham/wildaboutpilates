description: Feeling stronger, more flexible, and sleeping better
---

It's always lovely to hear people tell me that since coming to the classes they feel stronger and more flexible, they sleep better, and have less or even no pain.

Exercise can be used not only for strengthening and improving fitness but also for pain relief and management.

It just sometimes has to be prescribed at the right dose. And the best thing about this type of medicine is that there are no nasty side effects.

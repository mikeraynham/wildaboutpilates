## Updates

The latest advice from the [Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (16 March 2020)][6] is _"to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel"_.  Because of this I feel the responsible thing to do is postpone my classes.

This has been a difficult decision, but I feel it is the right one. My priority is to protect those who come to the class, our friends, family, and those at risk from becoming unwell from the virus.

There are two classes left on this block which will all roll over once we can start again.

For now, I encourage you all to continue some of the great strengthening and mobility exercises we do, especially squats, balance exercises, and some 4-point kneel work.

I'm sorry it has come to this, and I hope you understand the decision.  Please keep checking this page and your email for the latest updates. As soon as we can get going again we will!

Classes are running as usual, but please be aware that the government has announced that the UK is [moving out of the contain phase and into the delay phase][3] of the action plan.  Individuals are advised to protect themselves by washing their hands more often than usual, for at least 20 seconds, with soap and water.  Make sure you cough or sneeze into a tissue and put it in a bin and wash your hands.

Anyone who shows the following symptoms are being asked to self-isolate for 7 days:

* A high temperature (37.8Â°C and above)

* A new, continuous cough

People with symptoms are now being advised to look for information on the [NHS website][3] and to use the [NHS 111 Online][4] service instead of the NHS 111 telephone service.

In light of the recent news on the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) I want to reassure people that we take hygiene and the protection of all class attendees seriously at Wild About Pilates.

The government has provided public information and guidelines around washing hands regularly throughout the day.  We have excellent facilities at the hall including washroom facilities.  Please feel free to wash hands before and after the sessions. I will also be cleaning the mats before and after every session.  Tissue roll will be provided for covering your blocks.

As always I'd like to remind you that you are free to bring your equipment should you wish to.

If anyone has any queries please email me directly.

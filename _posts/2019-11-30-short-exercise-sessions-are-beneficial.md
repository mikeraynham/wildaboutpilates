description: Even short sessions of activity can have health benefits, government advises

Don't have time for exercise? Do you think exercise has to be strenuous to be beneficial?  [Recent reports][1] show that short sessions of activity can be beneficial.

Except for those who have been advised not to exercise by a qualified health professional such as a doctor or specialist consultant, most people can exercise to some level irrespective of age or ability.  The benefits of exercise are _huge_ for both physical and mental health and I could talk all day on this!

The [government guidelines][2] recommend that each week, adults should accumulate:

* at least 150 minutes (22½ hours) of moderate intensity activity (such as brisk walking or cycling);

* or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity (such as running);

* or even shorter durations of very vigorous intensity activity (such as sprinting or stair climbing);

* or a combination of moderate, vigorous and very vigorous intensity activity

The guidelines also state that, at least twice a week, all adults should take part in activities that increase or maintain their muscle strength, and involve the use of major muscle groups in the upper and lower body.  For some, this may be too much and it's important to remember that even a little exercise is better than none, and gradually increasing exercise is sensible if you aren't used to doing any.

Most Physiotherapists are very pro-exercise and help people to get more active. I spend time with people listening to their health and fitness goals, any barriers to exercise they may have, we discuss medical history, look at the persons current ability and then together we plan a programme.

If you are interested in trying Pilates, but a class isn't for you, you could consider a [one-to-one session][3] with me. They are tailored to meet the individual's needs and it's a great way to begin an exercise programme that's right for you. Several people who now come to my classes started this way.

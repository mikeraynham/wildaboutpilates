Those of you who know me will know that I love netball.  I've been playing for a long time (over 25 years, yikes!), and I am very lucky to have been trained by some fantastic coaches, and to have played at both club and county level.

I'm passionate about improving sport performance, preventing injuries, and rehabilitating athletes.  I have created a fun and challenging one hour Pilates class, designed to target the key areas that I believe have an impact on our performance on the court.  This one-off class will give attendees a full body work-out; test their balance and control; and stretch, strengthen and mobilise the body.

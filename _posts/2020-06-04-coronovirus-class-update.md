description: Coronavirus (COVID-19); Updates on the virus and how it affects classes

I'll be meeting with the organisers at Morton Hall next week to discuss how we would go about opening (once we are permitted to do so) to keep everyone as safe as possible.

We are fortunate to have a large hall and class numbers are restricted anyway so that's a good start, but we will be considering additional measures and procedures.

I will keep everyone updated, but for now, we will continue with virtual [Zoom classes on a Thursday evening][1].

Thank you for your continued support.

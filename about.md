I have a lot of experience rehabilitating people who have pain or injuries, and a very good understanding of anatomy and physiology. I help people to become stronger, improve their joint mobility, balance, body awareness, and confidence, all while having fun and challenging themselves. Pilates has improved my health and wellbeing and enabled me to help lots of people during my career.

# About Me

Hello! My name is Chrissie Raynham-Wild and I'm a state registered Chartered Physiotherapist specialising in musculoskeletal physiotherapy, and a certified [<abbr title="The Australian Physiotherapy & Pilates Institute">APPI</abbr>][1] Matwork Pilates instructor. I have worked in the NHS for over 7 years, and prior to specialising in MSK, I completed rotations in other specialist areas including neurology, orthopaedics, stroke rehabilitation, respiratory medicine and elderly care and rehab.

Being an MSK physiotherapist means that I have a lot of experience of working with people who have pain or injuries. It also means I have a very good understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the body.

I use Pilates frequently during my practice, and it is my pleasure to be able to help people to become stronger, more flexible and improve posture and function, irrespective of their level of experience of Pilates or level of ability.

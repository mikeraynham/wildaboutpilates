I have worked in the NHS for over 8 years.  Prior to specialising in MSK, I completed rotations in other specialist areas including neurology, orthopaedics, stroke rehabilitation, respiratory medicine and elderly care and rehab.

Being an MSK physiotherapist means that I have a lot of experience of working with people who have pain or injuries. It also means I have a very good understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the body.

I use Pilates frequently during my practice.  I like to help people to become stronger, more flexible and to improve posture and function, irrespective of their level of experience of Pilates or level of ability.

I have a special interest in women's health Physiotherapy and strength & conditioning.  Not only has Pilates improved my strength, mobility, balance and body awareness, it has enabled me to help thousands of people during my career.

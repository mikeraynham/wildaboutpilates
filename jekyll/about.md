description: My name is Chrissie Raynham-Wild and I'm a state registered Chartered
  Physiotherapist specialising in musculoskeletal physiotherapy, and a certified APPI  Matwork
  Pilates instructor.
---

Through a combination of physiotherapy, Pilates, and a focus on well-being, I take a holistic approach, emphasising on long-term health, and helping individuals live active, fulfilling lives well into the future.

I am a passionate and experienced Pilates instructor, currently leading a number of classes and providing 1-2-1 sessions. Teaching Pilates is a personal joy and a hobby for me. My love for movement and fitness enhances my ability to help clients improve their strength, flexibility and overall wellbeing.

Beyond Pilates, I am an Advanced Clinical Specialist Physiotherapist with a strong background in musculoskeletal care and rehabilitation. With 15 years of NHS experience, I have developed expertise in complex patient assessment, treatment planning, and therapeutic techniques. I provide high-level clinical care, guiding both patients and junior staff in achieving optimal health outcomes.

In addition to my current role, I have also worked as a First Contact Practitioner (FCP), serving as the first point of contact for patients presenting with musculoskeletal issues. In this role, I independently assessed, diagnosed, and managed a wide range of conditions, streamlining patient pathways and reducing pressure on primary care services.

I am currently studying an MSc in Advanced Physiotherapy at Manchester Metropolitan University and my specialist interests include post-natal exercise, persistent musculoskeletal pain management, sports rehabilitation, strength training, and breast cancer post-operative rehabilitation.

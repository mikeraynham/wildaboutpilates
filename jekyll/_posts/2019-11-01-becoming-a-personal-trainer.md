description: Receiving my Active IQ Level 2 Certificate in Gym Instructing
---

A couple of months ago I began working on my goal to become a qualified personal trainer and here I am at [5S Fitness][1] in Macclesfield receiving my [Active IQ Level 2 Certificate in Gym Instructing][2].  The next step is level 3, after which I will be fully qualified.

I’d like to thank Jason Curtis from 5S Fitness for his time, dedication, and mentoring during the course.

There is a lot that physiotherapists can learn from strength and conditioning coaches, and I’m lucky to have found someone so knowledgeable and enthusiastic on the topic.

Bring on level 3 in the new year!

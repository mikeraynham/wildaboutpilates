  Busy Mums.
---

I'm once again collaborating with [Yoga Spirits][1] in Mobberley to provide a Yoga & Pilates Workshop for Busy Mums. It's a relax, recharge and strengthening workshop with exercises tailored exclusively for postnatal recovery.

The class costs £25 per person (or £20 for those who have attended previously) and includes refreshments and a healthy snack.

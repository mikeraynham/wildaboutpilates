I am very excited to announce that Iâ€™ll be starting a new class on Wednesday 18 September 2019; these are in addition to my Thursday classes.

Booking is essential because spaces are limited. This ensures everyone gets more of my attention and the correct techniques are adopted.  See the [classes page]({% link classes.md %}) for more information.

### When

Wednesday class: <time>14:00</time>-<time>15:00</time>.

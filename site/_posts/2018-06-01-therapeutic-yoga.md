I'm very excited to soon be attending an introduction to Therapeutic Yoga course. I love learning and exploring new techniques to enrich my classes and bring maximum benefit to my clients. Although my classes are predominantly Pilates-based, I do like to add my own therapeutic and balance exercises.

It will cover a variety of beginner level poses and techniques which will facilitate postural education, correct movement patterning, body/breath awareness, as well as helping clients find alignment in their bodies.

This course will also explore the power of the mind-body connection that provides a holistic approach to any rehabilitation program.

I can't wait to share this with my class.

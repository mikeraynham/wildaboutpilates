Taster session

: First session is free, with no obligation. At Wild About Pilates we want people to come and see what it's all about.

Block bookings

: The classes are £10.00 per session and run in blocks of 6 consecutive classes which are to be paid in full in advance. Block-bookings take priority over ad-hoc bookings, and your place will be reserved.

Ad-hoc sessions

: Ad-hoc classes are £12 per session and subject to availability. Booking is essential. Please text me or email and I will get back to you to confirm your place.

Refer a friend

: If you refer a friend into one of the classes (it doesn't have to be the same class that you attend), and they sign up to a block of 6, the referrer gets a free session in their next block.

### Virtual Classes

Virtual (Zoom) classes are £10 per session and run in blocks of 6 consecutive classes which are to be paid in full in advance. A one-to-one session may be required first.

### One-to-one sessions

If you are interested in trying Pilates, but a class isn't for you, you could consider a one-to-one session with me. They are tailored to meet the individual's needs and it's a great way to begin an exercise programme that's right for you. Several people who now come to my classes started this way.

60-minute initial assessment: £60

: This includes an assessment of your posture, spinal range of movement and muscle length and function. You will learn the Pilates key elements and how to engage your centre. I will teach you some of the main Pilates exercises, and you will be provided with exercises which are tailored specifically to help you, which you can practice independently in your own time.

60 minute tailored session: £60

: You must have completed the initial assessment first.

## Venue

### Gawsworth Village Hall, Macclesfield

Gawsworth Village Hall is on Church Lane and opened in 1953. It is used by a number of community organisations including the Bridge Club, the Parish Council and the Women's Institute (WI). The hall underwent a £50,000 refurbishment in 2017. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.2303733,-2.1688624,3a,90y,140.17h,82.29t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipMcPedMvoto3adPyxireF72yFfo_q5HrEAY2Ats!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMcPedMvoto3adPyxireF72yFfo_q5HrEAY2Ats%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya331.4644-ro0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352">View the refurbished hall on Google Maps</a>.

## Am I suitable for the class?

Modified Pilates is suitable for most people, including those with injuries or those who suffer from back or other joint pain. As a physiotherapist, I can modify the exercises so that you can exercise comfortably and safely.

I need to be aware of any medical problems or injuries that might impact your training, and as such, all new members must complete a health questionnaire.  It is also very important that you keep me up-to-date with any changes to your health.

It is essential that you can get down to floor level and back up, as there is a mat-based element to every class.

If you have recently had surgery please discuss this with me first.

Postnatal women can come once they have had clearance from their doctor.  This will be at their 6-week medical check-up for a normal delivery, or 12-week check-up for a caesarean section, providing there are no complications.  Pilates is a great way to address any imbalances and postural changes after pregnancy.  We also include pelvic floor exercises which is an important group of muscles that can become weakened after pregnancy and birth.

At present this class isn't suitable for pregnant women, but this is something that I will review again and may change in due course.

In some cases, a letter from your doctor may be required if you have a complex medical history. In some instances, it may be more appropriate for you to have a one-to-one assessment or lessons before attending the class. If you have any concerns about your health or ability to participate, please get in touch and we can discuss this further.

## What is meant by 'modified Pilates'?

Traditional Pilates was designed over 100 years ago in Germany Joseph H. Pilates. His original method was based on 34 mat based movements, which consisted of strengthening, stretch and mobility exercises. Some of these movements are, however, very challenging, and only suitable for elite level strong and flexible athletes. Most people don't have that level of ability, so the founders of The Australian Physiotherapy and Pilates Institute (with which I have done my training) reviewed and modified the exercises. The vast majority of people can now participate, regardless of their ability, posture, or injuries.

## What can Pilates do for me?

Pilates has rapidly grown in popularity and is recommended by physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals. When taught correctly it can safely challenge you and provide some therapeutic benefits:

Core Stability and Strength

: You will learn how to engage your centre and build strength in all the major muscle groups, including your gluteal muscles and abdominals. Strengthening is a vital component of rehabilitation and injury prevention. It also helps to improve performance in many sports.

Posture

: You will improve proprioception, body awareness, and learn good form for different exercises.

Flexibility

: You will stretch muscles and mobilise joints gently and safely.

Balance

: Improving your balance has many benefits, including lowering the risk of falls.

Fitness

: You will improve your exercise tolerance in a friendly non-competitive environment.

Breathing, relaxation & well-being

: My aim is that you leave feeling relaxed and calm, while still knowing that you have had a good workout.

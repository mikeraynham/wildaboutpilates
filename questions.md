# Questions & answers

## Am I suitable for the class?

Modified Pilates is suitable for most people, including those with injuries or those who suffer from back or other joint pain. As a physiotherapist I can modify the exercises so that you can exercise comfortably and safely.

I need to be aware of any medical problems or injuries that might impact your training, and as such, all new members must complete a health questionnaire.  It is also very important that you keep me up-to-date with any changes to your health.

It is essential that you are able to get down to floor level and back up, as there is a mat based element to every class.

If you have recently had surgery please discuss this with me first.

Postnatal women can come once they have had clearance from their doctor, either at their 6 week medical check up for a normal delivery, or 12 weeks for a caesarean section providing there are no complications. Pilates is a great way to get back into shape after having a baby.

At present this class isn't suitable for pregnant women, but this is something that I will review again and may change in due course.

In some cases, a letter from your doctor may be required if you have a complex medical history, and in some instances it may be more appropriate for you to have a one-to-one assessment or lessons prior to attending the class. If you have any concerns about your health or ability to participate, please get in touch and we can discuss this further.

## What you can expect from Wild About Pilates?

* Small group sizes; no more than 12 in a class, meaning more care and attention for you.

* If you do an exercise that doesn't feel right for you — tell me and we can modify it so that you can join in every step of the way and achieve your goals.  My musculoskeletal physiotherapy experience helps me to help you.

* Lots of tips, good attention to detail so you get the most from the exercises.

* An all-round workout: all major muscle groups will be addressed, so you should come away feeling positive about a well balanced and challenging excercise plan.

* A friendly, non-competitive environment. Everyone is encouraged to work at their own level of comfort and ability.

* The venue has been chosen so you have ample space to move and stretch without feeling cramped.

* Varied and fun sessions: I use a variety of equipment, and each session is different so you won't be left doing the same routine week in week out.

## What is meant by 'modified Pilates'?

Traditional Pilates was designed over 100 years ago in Germany Joseph H. Pilates. His original method was based on 34 mat based movements, which consisted of strengthening, stretch and mobility exercises. Some of these movements are, however, very challenging, and only suitable for elite level strong and flexible athletes. Most people don't have that level of ability, so the founders of The Australian Physiotherapy and Pilates Institute (with which I have done my training) reviewed and modified the exercises, to enable the vast majority of people to be able to participate regardless of their ability, posture or injuries.

## What will Pilates do for me?

Pilates has rapidly grown in popularity, and is recommended by physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals, because when taught correctly it can safely challenge you and provide a number of therapeutic benefits:

Core Stability and Strength

: You will learn how to engage your centre and build strength in all the major muscle groups, including your gluteal muscles and abdominals. Strengthening is a vital component of rehabilitation and injury prevention. It also helps to improve performance in many sports.

Posture

: You will learn the five key elements that help promote good posture and body awareness.

Flexibility

: You will stretch muscles and mobilise joints gently and safely.

Balance

: Improving your balance has many benefits, including lowering the risk of falls.

Fitness

: You will improve your exercise tolerance in a friendly non-competitive environment.

Breathing, relaxation & well-being

: My aim is that you leave feeling relaxed and calm, while still knowing that you have had a good workout.
